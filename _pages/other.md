* [Zero-Dimensional Group](https://zerodimensional.group/ "Zero-Dimensional Group") - This is the link for the study group I was a part of while studying in Newy. There are many interesting and useful tools for research work on the tab "Miscellaneous". The website also contains a big collection of talks given on many areas of research related to group theory (and topological groups) on the "Videos" tab.
